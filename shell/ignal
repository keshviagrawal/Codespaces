[1mNAME[0m
       kill - send a signal to a process

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mkill [22m[options] <pid> [...]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  default  signal for kill is TERM.  Use [1m-l [22mor [1m-L [22mto list available signals.  Particularly useful sig‚Äê
       nals include HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in  three  ways:  [1m-9[22m,
       [1m-SIGKILL  [22mor  [1m-KILL[22m.  Negative PID values may be used to choose whole process groups; see the PGID column
       in ps command output.  A PID of [1m-1 [22mis special; it indicates all processes except the kill process  itself
       and init.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m<pid> [...][0m
              Send signal to every <pid> listed.

       [1m-<signal>[0m
       [1m-s <signal>[0m
       [1m--signal <signal>[0m
              Specify the [1msignal [22mto be sent.  The signal can be specified by using name or number.  The behavior
              of signals is explained in [1msignal[22m(7) manual page.

       [1m-q[22m, [1m--queue [4m[22mvalue[0m
              Use  [1msigqueue[22m(3)  rather  than  [1mkill[22m(2) and the value argument is used to specify an integer to be
              sent with the signal. If the receiving process has installed a handler for this signal  using  the
              SA_SIGINFO  flag  to [1msigaction[22m(2), then it can obtain this data via the si_value field of the sig‚Äê
              info_t structure.

       [1m-l[22m, [1m--list [22m[[4msignal[24m]
              List signal names.  This option has optional argument, which will convert signal number to  signal
              name, or other way round.

       [1m-L[22m, [1m--table[0m
              List signal names in a nice table.

       [1mNOTES  [22mYour  shell  (command line interpreter) may have a built-in kill command.  You may need to run the
              command described here as /bin/kill to solve the conflict.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       [1mkill -9 -1[0m

       [1mkill -l 11[0m
              Translate number 11 into a signal name.

       [1mkill -L[0m
              List the available signal choices in a nice table.

       [1mkill 123 543 2341 3453[0m
              Send the default signal, SIGTERM, to all those processes.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       This command meets appropriate standards. The [1m-L [22mflag is Linux-specific.

       ]8;;albert@users.sf.net\Albert Cahalan]8;;\ wrote kill in 1999 to replace a bsdutils one that was not standards compliant.  The  util-
       linux one might also work correctly.
